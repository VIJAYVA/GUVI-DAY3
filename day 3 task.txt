1.For the given JSON iterate over all for loops (for, for in, for of, forEach)



for loop=> The value is first set with an appropriate condition, which is also called ‘initializing a loop’. Next, the terminal or final value is specified. The For Loop makes things really easy when you need to run a set of codes multiple times.
For in loop=> Another way of looping is the For In Loop. Unlike the For Loop, this loop won’t be using a counter. So, this makes the whole process even more simple and hassle-free. In fact, the For In Loop is essentially a simplified version of the For Loop.
for of=>The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects, including: built-in String, Array, array-like objects (e.g., arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables. It invokes a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property of the object.
for each=> 1.The forEach() method calls a function for each element in an array.
                       2.The forEach() method is not executed for empty elements.
